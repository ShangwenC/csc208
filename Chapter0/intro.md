# A Review of Mathematical Statements

*While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a knave, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:*

*Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.*

*Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.*

*Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.*

*Which troll is which?*

Essentially, this section covers the types of mathematical statements, and explains that the higher level math you go, the less numbers and more words you find in your problems.
