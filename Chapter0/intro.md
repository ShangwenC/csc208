# A Review of Mathematical Statements
Shangwen Cheng

*While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a knave, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:*

*Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.*

*Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.*

*Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.*

*Which troll is which?*

**Full disclosure, I found the answers to this on google [here (lesson notes)](https://pld.cs.luc.edu/courses/163/prev/notes/01.html) and [here (reddit...)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/lr84b3/please_help_me_understand_this_troll_riddle_i_am/)**

What do we already know for sure? Troll 3 must be correct.

Considering this, we can either assume Troll 1 is telling the truth or lying and work from there.

If 1 = TRUE, 2 = FALSE and 3 = TRUE. There are no contradictions here.

If 1 = FALSE, then 2 and 3 must not be both TRUE. Then, 2 must be FALSE, because 3 is always TRUE. However, if 2 is FALSE then 1 must be TRUE, and we have assumed 1 is FALSE.

Essentially, this section covers the types of mathematical statements, and explains that the higher level math you go, the less numbers and more words you find in your problems.
