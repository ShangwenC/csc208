# Notes
Simple math that rapidly gets more complicated as you add layers. Not so much tricky mathematics as it is tricky logic.

## Additive Principle
If two events occur seperately and ONLY separately (the events must be *disjoint*) then use addition.

## Multiplicative Principle
Sometimes addition can be turned into multiplication to simplify the process, because that's how math works. If each occurance of one event will lead to a set possibility of occurances for another event, use multiplication.

## Counting with Sets
An important but boring proof of the additive and multiplicative principles. Understanding deepends possible applications.

*This would be so much easier to write if it was on paper...*

## Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion
Also uses sets

## Subsets
Subsets are

## Bit Strings
Strings of binary digits

- length: number of bits
- weight: number of 1s

## Lattice Paths
Set of points where (x,y) are integers. Nice grid pattern.

## Binomial Coefficients

## Pascal's Triangle
Dr. Rankin taught us this!! Hated it though.

## Permutations
n! (n factorial)

Also taught by Dr. Rankin. Most graphing calculators nowadays (i.e. Desmos) can solve them for you.
