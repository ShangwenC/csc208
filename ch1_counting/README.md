# Notes
Simple math that rapidly gets more complicated as you add layers. Not so much tricky mathematics as it is tricky logic.

## Additive Principle
If two events occur seperately and ONLY separately (the events must be *disjoint*) then use addition.

## Multiplicative Principle
Sometimes addition can be turned into multiplication to simplify the process, because that's how math works. If each occurance of one event will lead to a set possibility of occurances for another event, use multiplication.

## Counting with Sets
An important but boring proof of the additive and multiplicative principles. Understanding deepends possible applications.

*This would be so much easier to write if it was on paper...*

## Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion
Also uses sets

## Excercises
